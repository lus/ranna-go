# ranna-go

`ranna-go` is a Golang client implementation for the code execution sandbox [`ranna`](https://github.com/ranna-go/ranna).

**Please note:** `ranna` already provides a Golang client implementation [here](https://github.com/ranna-go/ranna/tree/master/pkg/client). If this is enough for you, go for it.
With this library I aim at providing a generic client for ranna **plus** the according other microservices ([`snippets`](https://github.com/ranna-go/snippets)).
